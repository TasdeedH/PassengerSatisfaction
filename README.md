# PassengerSatisfaction_PoDS

----

A comprehensive academic report produced as a submission for the Principles of Data Science module as part of my MSc Data Science Course at City, University of London.

Programming Languages: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn)

The report provides a comprehensive analysis into the determination of what airline services yield more satisfied passengers, accounting for different classes of passengers e.g.
Business and Economy, an examination of different subsets of satisfied customers through the use of clustering and well as the development of a suitable model predicting
satisfaction which yielded a 96% testing accuracy.

The following questions were investigated:

1. Do personal demographic factors such as Age and Gender contribute to Passenger Satisfaction?
2. Does the class of a passenger indeed have an effect on satisfaction? If so, can we investigate what services are most important between Economy and Business Class?
3. Can we identify the most important services that contribute to satisfaction?
4. Do subgroups appear amongst satisfied passengers in which different services are more important?
5. Is it possible to devise a reliable model to predict passenger satisfaction? How much contribution do the services we deemed important have?

Paper Abstract:

The aim of this study was to analyze which airline services contributed most to passenger satisfaction and which services should be emphasized to boost satisfaction and 
increase loyalty. Twelve services were deemed important overall, subsets of these being more important accounting for class, where significantly more services were vital in business class compared to lower tiers. Clustering techniques were applied to identify subgroups of satisfied passengers and machine learning models were implemented to assess how well satisfaction could be determined.

Analysis showed airlines should focus on improving services for those in lower classes who were easily satisfied but suffered poor satisfaction rates before improving services
for business class where rates were already high. Airlines should further incorporate incentive programs to holidaymakers alongside. The optimal model provided excellent
predictive capabilities with 96% accuracy hence a beneficial tool for airlines to quickly analyze satisfaction given large passenger numbers

A very interesting paper in my opinion, for which many avenues for further analysis highlighted as well as useful insights and recommendations to airlines.
